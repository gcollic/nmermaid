# Mermaid C# library

This library helps generate [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagram from C#.

Only flow charts are available at the moment.

You can find the documentation for them [here](./Nmermaid.DocAsTests/Docs/FlowchartDoc.All.verified.md).

The documentation and testing are done with the [documentation testing](https://sfauvel.github.io/documentationtesting/) approach. The tests are samples for the documentation, and are green as long as actual output are consistent with the documentation.
